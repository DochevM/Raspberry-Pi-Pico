# Used sensors

## DHT11-Digital temperature and humidity sensor
The [DHT11](https://store.comet.bg/Catalogue/Product/50012/) is a basic, ultra low-cost digital temperature and humidity sensor. It uses a capacitive humidity sensor and a thermistor to measure the surrounding air, and spits out a digital signal on the data pin (no analog input pins needed). 

 ### Library used for DHT11
 - [DHT sensor library](https://github.com/adafruit/DHT-sensor-library?utm_source=platformio&utm_medium=piohome)

## DHT22-Digital temperature and humidity sensor
[DHT22](https://store.comet.bg/Catalogue/Product/50013/) (or AM2302) is also a low cost digital temperature and humidity sensor, but it has a better accuracy and bigger range of the readings.
 ### Library for DHT22

## DS18B20-Digital temperature sensor
The [DS18B20](https://store.comet.bg/Catalogue/Product/29267/) is a digital temperature sensor provides 9-bit to 12-bit Celsius temperature measurements and has an alarm function with nonvolatile user-programmable upper and lower trigger points. Each DS18B20 has a unique 64-bit serial code, which allows multiple DS18B20s to function on the same 1-Wire bus.
